# Targeted_Debiasing
MSc Research - Feature targeting debiasing for Machine Learning applications in finance

In this thesis, we tackle the important research problem of algorithmic bias in Machine
Learning (ML). A key issue that potentially compromises the fairness and transparency of
predictive models, this bias is often embedded within specific features of the model. We focus
on using feature importance as a tool to surface and reduce this bias, striving for a method
that decreases the bias induced by individual features without sacrificing their predictive
power. This focused approach represents a departure from traditional strategies that aim to
debias data as a whole. We aim to mitigate the size of the typical accuracy-bias tradeoff that
is common in algorithmic fairness research. By preserving the predictive power of the model
while simultaneously reducing bias, we aim to achieve a balance of fairness and accuracy, a
highly desired yet elusive goal in Machine Learning.
